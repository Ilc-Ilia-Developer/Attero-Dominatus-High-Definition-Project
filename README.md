# The Attero Dominatus High Definition Project

This project aims to develop a custom neural network capable of upscaling old music videos, such as Attero Dominatus and Cliffs of Gallipoli, to high definition (1080p). By leveraging artificial intelligence, we seek to enhance the quality of these videos, preserving their artistic value for future generations.

# Approach

The approach that is currently being tested is upscaling using a custom neural network, trained to upscale the video correctly. The problem is that the Attero Dominatus video is very dark in some scenes and the old technology at the time made some of the frames too blurry for the AI to fix (like the planes in the beginning seconds of the video). There are also several glitches that also need to be accounted for in the training of the model.
